UK proptech startup Tract raises funding to address housing problem through AI: Here’s how,"London-based Tract, a proptech startup specialised in sourcing potential building sites and acquiring planning permissions through AI, announced that it has secured undisclosed investment co-led by Ada Ventures and Concept Ventures.

The company will use the funds to develop the technology to generate surveys, reports, and other planning documentation.

The UK company plans to build one million homes in ten years.

Tract: Addressing housing problem through AI

Founded by Jamie Rumbelow and Henry Dashwood, Tract is on a mission to use technology to address the housing problem and create a positive societal impact.

“We believe that housing is the largest domestic political problem the United Kingdom faces and that the planning system is the biggest barrier to solving it,” says the company.

The company’s sophisticated planning engine simplifies the complex process of obtaining planning permissions and has the potential to unlock a completely unserved market of smaller land parcels.

- A message from our partner -



Tract’s planning engine is capable of identifying sites with favourable planning characteristics and determining the type of development that can be carried out on a site, along with the necessary documentation.

By digitising and organising extensive local planning data, the software can assess planning risk by analysing past applications and predicting likely outcomes.

According to the company’s claims, its technology has the potential to revolutionise the real estate industry by addressing complex and unpredictable permission processes for smaller land parcels.

Similarly, it could free up land owned by large institutional landowners for productive use. It could also maximise the potential value of the land. A planning permission raises the median value of agricultural land from £20k/ha to £2.4m/ha.

The company’s software helps understand the value of land, and the planning constraints that might affect its viability.

Tract will identify the most viable land, promote it on behalf of landowners, get planning permission for homes, and sell the land to people who want to build houses, taking a percentage of the increase in value.

According to the company, Tract believes there are around 200,000 sites suitable for building in the UK that could benefit from the software.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/tract-raises-funding/

Denmark’s Uniqkey bags €5.3M to make cybersecurity user-centric,"Hovedstaden-based Uniqkey, a company that offers password and access management solution, has raised €5.35M in funding to expand its cybersecurity solution across Europe, helping companies become more resilient to cyber-attacks and data theft.

According to a statement from Uniqkey, rising geopolitical tensions and decades of underinvestment in digital infrastructure have left Europe dependent on foreign technology, threatening its digital sovereignty. Uniqkey aims to bolster Europe’s digital independence.

Investors supporting Uniqkey

The round was led by Swedish VC BackingMinds, with contributions from industry veterans including Jesper Zerlang (former CEO of Logpoint), Lars Ankjer, Otto Krabbe, Rolf Bladt, and several notable angels and key employees.

Susanne Najafi, Founding Partner at BackingMinds, says, “At BackingMinds, we invest in what we call blind spots – overlooked areas with great potential. With less than 1 per cent of all founders in Cyber security being immigrants and with only 2 per cent of all Cyber security startups coming from the Nordics, Uniqkey stands out as a hidden gem.”

Sara Wimmercranz, Founding Partner at BackingMinds, adds, “After tracking 500+ cybersecurity startups across Europe, it was clear that Uniqkey stood out. We have been impressed by Hakan, the company’s management team, their technical expertise and are very happy to support them in their mission to protect Europe from the growing cyber threat.”

Aiming to become the go-to security solution

Companies often underestimate the threat of cyber-attacks, which can devastate their operations, especially as digital footprints grow with remote work.

- A message from our partner -



Uniqkey’s military-grade cybersecurity solution addresses this by offering encrypted password protection directly to employees, significantly enhancing security.

By requiring a mobile app for system logins—similar to national ID apps used for banking—Uniqkey ensures high-level encryption and eliminates the need for users to remember passwords, mitigating the risk of data theft and cyber-attacks.

Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey, says, “Today, everybody’s got a mobile phone. Mobile phones have become an essential way we access our everyday life online. That is exactly why we’ve made the mobile phone central to Uniqkey’s security solution, and a big part of why we’re seeing great demand for our solution.”

“In the same fashion, as mobile apps have changed the way we send money instantly or access our bank accounts, Uniqkey will change the way we access systems internally within the company – easy, fast and secure.”

Uniqkey aims to evolve beyond password protection to become a complete digital security guard for employees, focusing on education and enhancing cyber awareness across organisations.

The company looks to bolster the security of European citizens and companies against cyberattacks.

Capital utilisation

Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey, says, “Today we protect 500+ SMEs across Europe and we’ve seen great demand for our cyber security solution, having grown 100 per cent YoY over the past two years.”

“We can really feel the pull in the market and want to keep investing in growth and product. With the investment, we invest in continued growth and keep up with the latest safety standards.”

Simon Cederstråhle Hellstrøm-Melander, CMO of Uniqkey, adds, “This new funding will help accelerate the way we scale our technology to thousands of companies across Europe in the coming years. Protecting SMEs is at the heart of what we do and hopefully, we can play an important part in Europe’s rising cyber landscape.”

Brief about Uniqkey

Founded by Danish entrepreneur Hakan Yagci, Uniqkey emerged from the need to balance cybersecurity with usability. Initially developed to secure his previous company, Uniqkey has evolved into a solution addressing major security challenges.

The company now provides a password and access management system, delivering military-grade security with convenience for IT and employees alike.

Yagci launched the company after encountering challenges with cybersecurity solutions in his prior role. Following his departure from OrderYoyo, which was IPO’d in 2021, Yagci founded Uniqkey, built a team, and grew the company to 50 employees.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/denmarks-uniqkey-bags-e5-3m/
Amsterdam-based SELANA introduces the first legal E-step in the Netherlands: Know more,"Amsterdam-based SELANA, an e-mobility startup, announced on Thursday that it has introduced SELANA Alpha, the upcoming first legally approved E-step in the Netherlands.

SELANA Alpha, developed after five years of R&D, is scheduled for Q4 2024 launch. With this, the Dutch company aims to offer a safe, sustainable, and convenient alternative to cars in cities.

Birth of SELANA Alpha

Founded by Chingiskhan Kazakhstan and Max Schalow, SELANA is at the forefront of E-mobility innovation, producing and selling micromobility vehicles to B2B clients worldwide.

Talking about the motivation behind developing a legal e-scooter in the Netherlands to Silicon Canals, Chingiskhan Kazakhstan, CEO and co-founder of SELANA, says, ” Five years ago the E-scooter boom was happening in the US, and after we bought a couple ourselves, we loved it so much and believed that it’s the future of urban travel that can replace cars and make cities safer and cleaner. So we thought, why not bring them to the Netherlands? However, we found out they were illegal. Thought it might take a year at most, but it wasn’t that easy.”

With the Alpha, SELANA aims to redefine urban transportation, offering a convenient, safe, and sustainable alternative to traditional vehicles.

Challenges

As of today, no throttle E-steps are legally approved under Dutch road safety regulations. Over 200,000 illegal E-steps roam the Dutch streets, and police enforce a €400 fine and take away the illegal E-step.

- A message from our partner -



Explaining the challenges, Kazakhstan adds, “Starting a startup as an international student in a university involves typical hurdles such as learning how to do it, making plans, raising funding during COVID, and dealing with stress. In addition to these challenges, there are numerous regulatory obstacles that a typical deep tech startup must overcome when developing hardware or software products, establishing quality systems, obtaining certifications, becoming a manufacturer, and passing tests. This has been the ongoing reality for the past five years, a time period during which most people would have given up.”

What makes SELANA Alpha special?

SELANA’s e-scooter comes with its legal status and advanced features:

Speed : Maximum 25 km/h, adhering to legal limits

: Maximum 25 km/h, adhering to legal limits Safety Features : Front and rear brakes, turning lights, and 10-inch air tyres

: Front and rear brakes, turning lights, and 10-inch air tyres Smart Technology: NFC keycard unlocking and tracking capabilities

“We, as manufacturers, are listed alongside car manufacturers like Toyota and Tesla, so maintaining top-notch quality control is essential even as a startup. That’s why our product includes extra safety features and certified parts. For instance, due to a regulation change, we had to adjust the position of the front turning lights by a couple of centimetres. Due to this modification we created a completely new design and mold, resulting in significant expenses,” states Kazakhstan.

Priced at €1,900, the Alpha positions itself as an alternative to illegal E-steps and higher-priced competitors like the VanMoof S5 at €3,298.

“We tested it with any age, gender, and background, and with 0 experience, they tried it and loved it right away. This can increase inclusivity on the roads and provide a great convenient alternative to cars. It’s already proven itself in other countries, and the Netherlands with its bike lanes and culture, will be a perfect example to the rest of the world of how the future urban mobility should look like,” he adds.

SELANA is launching an exclusive pre-order campaign with a refundable €100 deposit. Through this pre-order campaign, customers can secure their place on the waitlist for the Alpha.

The Dutch company anticipates strong market reception, projecting sales of 10,000 units in 2025.

Moving forward

In terms of future plans, SELANA aims to expand by growing its partner dealer and service network.

“Introduce a more affordable version for the mass market, similar to Tesla’s strategy. Expand our offerings to meet actual needs, not just another electric car, but possibly something smaller,” he adds.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/selana-introduces-first-legal-e-step/
Estonian renewable energy producer Sunly secures €300M,"Tallinn-based Sunly, a renewable energy producer, announced that it has secured €300M in debt financing to drive the development of 1.3 GW of solar, wind, storage, and hybrid parks in the Baltics and Poland.

Sunly is an independent energy producer focused on developing renewable energy projects in the Baltics and Poland. It also manages a portfolio of renewable energy and electrification startups in Estonia.

The company was founded by the 4Energia team after selling 4Energia to Enefit Green AS, at which point 4Energia was the largest renewable energy company in the Baltics. Currently, Sunly operates with local teams in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.

Investors supporting Sunly

The funding comes from Rivage Investment via its REDI HR2 fund and Fund for Infrastructure Climate Solutions, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) through its Green Credit Fund I, and Norway’s largest pension company, KLP, via CIP-managed funds.

​Gaétane Tracz, Partner and Head of the Infrastructure Debt team at Rivage, says, “We are delighted to support Sunly’s strong leadership team through their ambitious growth trajectory and to help accelerate the construction of hybrid renewable energy parks across the Baltics and Poland.”

“We share Sunly’s mission of contributing to produce power with purpose, to contribute to European Union energy security and to deliver investments with both attractive performance and ESG impact.”

- A message from our partner -



​Jakob Groot, Partner at CIP and Co-Head of the CI Green Credit Fund I, adds, “We are very excited to start our partnership with Sunly, and their highly experienced management team. This financing package will contribute significantly to the development and construction of renewable energy projects, supporting the decarbonisation ambitions across the Baltics and Poland, and represents an attractive investment for our Green Credit Fund I.”

Capital utilisation

​Priit Lepasepp, co-founder and CEO of Sunly, says, “This investment enables us to improve our infrastructure with new grid connections and solar parks in the Baltics, which will support our onshore wind and storage pipeline expansion.”

“To help reduce energy costs, our focus will be on two key areas: building a hybrid pipeline with storage capabilities and advancing the electrification of heating and mobility systems, thereby diminishing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and optimising the use of local renewable resources.”

Sunly plans to develop integrated hybrid parks that combine wind, solar, and energy storage at a single connection point with a direct line to consumers. This approach stabilises energy production in varying weather conditions and reduces grid connectivity charges, which are expected to account for over half of total energy costs.

The strategy aims to enhance regional energy security and operational efficiency, benefiting consumers, especially large industrial clients with high energy consumption.

On a mission to ensure the availability of clean energy

The 244 MW Risti solar park in Estonia is one of the first projects to benefit from Sunly’s financing, capable of powering 55,000 households annually.

Planned as a hybrid park, it may later include wind turbines and battery storage. Construction will also begin on four solar parks in Latvia, totalling 553 MW, with future plans to add wind or battery storage.

The 1.3 GW portfolio further includes large hybrid solar parks in Lithuania and various solar parks in Poland, all to be completed by the end of 2026.

Sunly’s expansion is backed by a total of €765M in debt and equity capital from investors, including Mirova, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and various banks.

In 2023, the company raised €200M from existing investors to further develop solar and wind parks in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.",2024-08-29,https://siliconcanals.com/renewable-energy-producer-sunly-bags-e300m/

AppleVis finds new home with Be My Eyes: a win for blind and low vision tech users,"Be My Eyes, the Danish-founded app for blind and low-vision people is acquiring AppleVis, the go-to online blindness website for accessibility advice on Apple and other technologies.

With a worldwide community of nearly 700,000 users, and 7.5 million volunteers, Be My Eyes connects blind and low-vision users with sighted volunteers and companies, through live video and AI to tackle the inaccessible parts of everyday life, whether at home or at work; all for free to the end user.

The future of AppleVis, a much-loved online community with its active and engaged user base and vast resource of podcasts, forums, and reviews, looked bleak when its founder, David Goodwin, announced in July that it would need to close permanently at the end of August 2024.

While Apple as a company has demonstrated a strong commitment to supporting users with visual impairments through various accessibility features and initiatives, AppleVis was run entirely on a voluntary and unpaid basis — surely given Apple's financial resources and commitment to accessibility, it could have provided paid staff to support this crucial initiative?

But following a fervent chorus of community wishes and support, Be My Eyes will ensure the website’s long-term stability and growth.

“David Goodwin built something remarkable and immensely valuable, and when the Be My Eyes team discussed the possible closure, we quickly concluded that we had to do something to keep such an important and loved community resource available,” said Mike Buckley, CEO of Be My Eyes.

“From the first call with the AppleVis team, we not only learned that we shared the same values and mission, but that we also had similar ideas for how to grow AppleVis and make it even more useful in the future. As always, we will listen and learn first, and then continue to build AppleVis with the direct input and leadership of the blind and low-vision community.”

Under the terms of the acquisition, Be My Eyes will acquire the website and brand, and a licence to all content.

Be My Eyes has also agreed to ensure complete editorial independence for the AppleVis team and contributors going forward. It will also add two paid staff positions and retain key AppleVis volunteers under the new structure to ensure continuity and maintain its institutional knowledge.

To retain the editorial authenticity for the blind and low vision community, the new AppleVis organisation will report directly to Bryan Bashin, Vice Chairman of Be My Eyes.

Bashin, himself blind, has been a former science journalist, Commissioner for the US AbilityONE Commission, and former CEO of the San Francisco Lighthouse for the Blind.

AppleVis like all be My Eyes user features will continue to be free of charge for all of its users.

The acquisition means the site will be restored to full functionality on September 9th or before, in time for analysis of Apple’s autumn software releases. By then, all the traditional AppleVis content relevant to such upcoming releases as iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, including articles detailing what’s new for blind and DeafBlind users, podcast episodes, and blog posts detailing new and resolved VoiceOver bugs in the respective updates, will be there as usual.

“Fourteen years ago, I along with several others set out to make AppleVis the go to online resource for individuals who are blind or have low vision who wanted to learn more about accessible technologies, "" said David Goodwin, founder of AppleVis.",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/applevis-finds-new-home-with-be-my-eyes-a-win-for-blind-and-low-vision-tech-users/
Sunly secures €300M to transition to energy independence in the Baltics,"Estonian enewable energy producer Sunly has raised €300 million in debt financing to accelerate the construction of 1.3 GW of solar, wind, storage, and hybrid parks across the Baltics and Poland. This brings the company’s debt and equity capital from investors to €765 million.

As the EU actively works on reducing its dependence on Russian gas, it faces ongoing challenges.

In the Baltic states and Poland, Russia's significant influence in the regional energy market has historically exposed these areas to price fluctuations and supply disruptions associated with geopolitical tensions, often leading to higher energy costs for consumers than in other European nations. The upcoming desynchronisation from the Russian and Belarusian electricity grid in February next year aims to boost regional energy independence and security.

Sunly intends to develop integrated hybrid parks that combine wind, solar, and energy storage batteries at a single connection point and direct line to consumers.

This method improves energy production stability in various weather conditions and optimises cost-efficiency by reducing grid connectivity charges—forecasted to account for more than half of the total energy cost. The approach is expected to significantly benefit consumers, particularly large industrial clients with high energy consumption, by enhancing regional energy security and operational efficiency.

​Priit Lepasepp, co-founder and CEO of Sunly, said:

“This investment enables us to improve our infrastructure with new grid connections and solar parks in the Baltics, supporting our onshore wind and storage pipeline expansion. To help reduce energy costs, we will focus on two key areas: building a hybrid pipeline with storage capabilities and advancing the electrification of heating and mobility systems, thereby diminishing our reliance on imported fossil fuels and optimising the use of local renewable resources”.

This financing is provided by Rivage Investment via REDI HR2, its second high-yield infrastructure debt fund and its Fund for Infrastructure Climate Solutions, and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) through its Green Credit Fund I, with additional participation from Norwegian largest pension company Kommunal Landspensjonskasse (KLP) through funds managed by CIP.

One of the first projects to benefit from this financing is the 244 MW Risti solar park in Estonia, which can cover the annual electricity consumption of 55,000 households. Currently intended as a hybrid park, Sunly already has expansion plans that include onshore wind turbines and battery storage in the future.

Construction will also immediately start on four solar parks in Latvia, with a combined capacity of 553 MW. These Latvian parks are also designed as hybrids, with eventual plans to integrate wind or battery storage or a combination of both. The 1.3 GW portfolio also includes several large hybrid solar parks in Lithuania, as well as both small and large solar parks in Poland by the end of 2026.",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/sunly-secures-300m-to-transition-to-energy-independence-in-the-baltics/
Uniqkey Raises €5.35M to strengthen SME cybersecurity in Europe,"Denmark-based Uniqkey has raised €5.35 million to scale its cybersecurity solution across Europe and make companies more resilient to cyber attacks and data theft.

The biggest security risk Europe faces is the low security among its SMEs. 24.3 million SMEs make up 99.8 percent of all companies in Europe and the fact that 12 million SMEs (50 per cent) today don’t have a cyber security plan in place, could paralyse the European economy.

However, serious regulations in the area are just around the corner — NIS2 and DORA — which hold directors and boards personally responsible if the companies they represent don’t have good IT security implemented.

Just as GDPR changed the way companies process data, so NIS2 will change the way companies approach IT security.

Today, companies underestimate the risk of cyber-attacks that can effectively wipe out their existence. Employees leave larger data traces than ever before - due to increased digitisation and due to modern working methods such as ""work from anywhere"".

This makes companies vulnerable to cyber attacks and data theft. Uniqkey, with its military-grade cybersecurity solution, moves encrypted password protection to the individual employees, which strengthens every company against cyber attacks and data theft.

81 per cent of data theft and cyber attacks are due to poor or careless handling of passwords. This is why employees are often the main target for hackers. Uniqkey's solution requires a mobile app when logging into the company's systems — like we have local ID apps across Europe when using our bank accounts (Denmark: MitID, Sweden: BankID etc). It's easy and fast.

All passwords are encrypted to the highest standard and practically impossible to break — and users no longer have to remember their passwords.

According to Hakan Yagci, CEO and founder of Uniqkey:

“Today, everybody’s got a mobile phone. Mobile phones have become an essential way we access our everyday life online. That is exactly why we’ve made the mobile phone central to Uniqkey's security solution, and a big part of why we’re seeing great demand for our solution. In the same fashion as mobile apps have changed the way we send money instantly or access our bank accounts, Uniqkey will change the way we access systems internally within the company - easy, fast and secure. Today we protect 500+ SMEs across Europe and we’ve seen great demand for our cybersecurity solution, having grown 100 per cent YoY over the past two years. With this investment, we invest in continued growth and keep up with the latest safety standards.”

The investment was raised from BackingMinds, in combination with industry veterans such as Jesper Zerlang (ex-CEO of Logpoint), Lars Ankjer, Otto Krabbe, Rolf Bladt, and several well-known angels and key employees.

According to Susanne Najafi, Founding Partner at BackingMinds:

“At BackingMinds, we invest in what we call blind spots - overlooked areas with great potential. With less than 1 per cent of all founders in cybersecurity being immigrants and with only 2 per cent of all cybersecurity startups coming from the Nordics, Uniqkey stands out as a hidden gem.""

Naplasol acquires Mycorena to boost the mycelium and alt-protein market,"Naplasol, a member of the VEOS group, has acquired Swedish mycoprotein company Mycorena. With this acquisition, Naplasol will enhance its mycoprotein product portfolio and plans to produce Mycorena’s mycoprotein, Promyc®, at its industrial facility in Bree, Belgium.

In March 2022, Mycorena, which makes a mycelium protein ingredient for meat alternatives, raised €24 million, the largest Series A round on record for an alternative protein company across Europe. This was superseded this year when Infinite Roots raised $58 million.

Mycorena went on to raise €35 million in total funding and, in April this year received funding from the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Discovery Programme in recognition of its products’ potential for use on long-distance space missions.

However, in June, the company announced it was discontinuing its large-scale factory project in Sweden for Promyc, which is in part attributed to its failed attempts to raise Series B funding with SEB and Pareto Securities in 2022-2023.

In July, it filed for bankruptcy. COO and co-founder Ebba Fröling highlighted:

""The past few years have been extremely tough for us. Despite forming valuable partnerships and receiving support from our investors, it was not enough. We hope for the company to get new ownership in order to build on our significant groundwork and that the team, and their efforts, can remain the same.""

Wim Slee, co-CEO of VEOS Group, shared:

“Both companies, Naplasol and Mycorena, are active in the same field and have complementary knowledge and products of which we can benefit in the future. We are proud that we can continue the story of Mycorena, as we strongly believe in the future of mycoproteins.""

""Mycorena has been on an exciting journey toward becoming a leading player in the mycoprotein industry. The acquisition and merger with Naplasol offer a unique opportunity to build on the foundation we have established. We look forward to seeing Mycorena continue to thrive under the strong industrial expertise of the Veos Group,"" says Ramkumar Nair PhD, Founder of Mycorena.

VEOS Group was founded in 1974 and headquartered in Belgium, and operates production facilities worldwide for the food, pet food and feed industries, supported by a global sales network. The acquisition will enable Naplasol to offer a wider range of sustainable solutions for these industries.

Araya closes Super Angel Fund at $10.9M,"London-based Arāya Ventures has announced the $10.6 million first close of the Arāya Super Angel Fund - a community-powered fund which will invest in up to 60 pre-seed and seed stage founders across the next four years in health tech, fintech, climate, commerce and work. Fund investors include Bridgerton actress Charithra Chandran, former Credit Suisse CEO Phil Cutts and former Browns CEO Holli Rogers.

The Arāya Super Angel fund will invest pre-seed and seed cheques of $200k - $550k and will ""give founders access to significant value-add"" from Rupa, the Arāya Ventures team, the Super Angel Fund investors and Arāya’s extensive angel and proprietary scout network.

An exited entrepreneur, Founder & Managing Partner Rupa Popat has closed Arāya Ventures’ first fund with a plan to invest $25m via a community-powered model with the aim to be the ‘most value-add investor’ on the cap table.

The Arāya Super Angel fund will invest pre-seed and seed cheques of $200k - $550k and in addition will give founders access to significant value-add from Rupa, the Arāya Ventures team, the Super Angel Fund investors and Arāya’s extensive angel and proprietary scout network.

The Arāya Super Angel fund benefits from a flexible hybrid structure which accommodates both EIS and non-EIS investments. It will invest capital over a four-year deployment, with 10 to 15 investments per year to increase diversification and maximise on performance, reserving 25% for repeat founders who have already built a business previously.

Some of Rupa’s previous investments include sequel by repeat entrepreneur Alex Macdonald, Jude by Peony Li, Indē Wild by Diipa and Oleg Buller-Khosla and Lapse by Dan and Ben Silvertown which last year closed a $30 million Series A round. 52% of the existing portfolio companies have raised in or scaled into the U.S. market.

The Arāya Super Angel fund is powered by a community of over 80 fund investors including current and exited entrepreneurs such as Media Zoo founder Rachel Pendered, and Cambridge Spark founder & Chairman Dr Raoul-Gabriel Urma, angel and VC investors such as Niraj Pabari of Switzerland-based Giano Capital and former COO and co-founder of Precede Capital Partners Daljit Sandhu, operators, financial professionals from Royal Bank of Canada, Plurimi and Blackrock, C-suite leaders and family offices from a variety of industries. Some of the fund’s investors will also be on hand to support founders with their network and expertise across Data & AI, Go-to-market strategy, Fundraising, Growth, US expansion and more.

Over 15 percent of the fund is made up of family offices, which invest directly at Series A and B; at least 65% are from ethnic minority backgrounds; 60% are current or exited founders and 16% are from outside the UK across the US, Middle East, and India.

In addition to the fund investors, founders will have access to a combined 40+ years’ experience in Rupa and the Arāya team who are committed to providing more value “than a cheque” to their portfolio companies.

Founders will also benefit from Arāya Ventures Academy for Angels (AVA Angels) which will have 250 angel investor graduates by the end of 2024 and over 1,000 by the end of 2025. This is also part of the fund’s proprietary scout network and will offer the angel investors co-investment opportunities into deals backed by the fund.

Rupa Popat said: “This is Arāya Ventures’ first fund and I’m incredibly proud of what we’re able to offer both investors and founders.

“As a former founder turned investor, I’ve been on both sides of the table and I know that for most early-stage founders, whilst capital is important, it’s also about the additional value and support that investors can provide.

“Our approach is incredibly bespoke and personalised and with this unique structure, we’re optimising not only for performance, but plugging a gap to offer real support to early-stage founders and giving them value beyond the cheque.”",2024-08-29,https://tech.eu/2024/08/29/araya-closes-super-angel-fund-at-10-9m/

Saudi E-commerce Startups Secure Over USD 400M in Venture Funding in 2023,"– Saudi e-commerce startups attracted SR1.6 billion ($426.7 million) in venture capital funding in 2023, signaling robust sector growth.

– E-commerce platform users in Saudi Arabia are expected to reach 34.5 million by 2025, reflecting a 42 percent increase from 2019.

– E-commerce is set to contribute 12 percent to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by 2025, with 80 percent of transactions anticipated to be electronic by 2030.

Saudi Arabia’s e-commerce sector is experiencing significant growth, with venture capital investments in startups reaching SR1.6 billion ($426.7 million) in 2023, according to official data.

A report by the Small and Medium Enterprises General Authority (Monsha’at) forecasts that the number of e-commerce platform users in the Kingdom will hit 34.5 million by 2025, marking a 42 percent increase from 2019 to 2024.

This growth highlights the sector’s pivotal role in the Kingdom’s economic diversification strategy. The transformation of Saudi Arabia’s digital marketplace is part of a broader national effort to promote innovation and boost economic development.

The formation of the E-Commerce Council in 2018 was a strategic step to advance the sector, focusing on financial technology, payment solutions, and logistics improvements. These initiatives have positioned Saudi Arabia as one of the most dynamic e-commerce markets in the Middle East and North Africa.

In 2020, e-commerce accounted for 4 percent of the Kingdom’s GDP, with online purchases comprising 8 percent of goods and 25 percent of services, according to Muhannad Al-Mulhim, a consultant at the Ministry of Commerce. By year-end, e-commerce revenues are anticipated to reach SR211 billion. Despite this rapid expansion, e-commerce currently represents only 18 percent of total retail sales, indicating significant potential for growth.

Looking ahead, the sector is expected to contribute 12 percent to GDP by 2025, with a targeted compound annual growth rate of 15 percent from 2020 to 2025.

Al-Mulhim said: “According to the E-Commerce Council, developments in several key sectors, including infrastructure and the legislative environment, have been driven by programs under Saudi Vision 2030, such as the e-commerce stimulus program. This led to the issuance of the e-commerce system by the Ministry of Commerce.”

He added: “Additionally, the financial sector development program, in cooperation with the Saudi Central Bank, has resulted in a comprehensive development of the financial technology sector and prompted several transformations in the logistics services sector.”

By 2030, 80 percent of transactions in Saudi Arabia are projected to be conducted electronically, in line with the objectives of Vision 2030. As the Kingdom advances its ambitious agenda, the e-commerce sector is poised to be a key driver of economic diversification, innovation, and new business opportunities.",2024-08-29,https://waya.media/saudi-e-commerce-startups-secure-over-usd-400m-in-venture-funding-in-2023/
